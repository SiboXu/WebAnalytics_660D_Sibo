I've left off 1 of the 5 stars for 2 main reasons detailed in PRO's\/CON's list below:CONS:1- Without (very) fresh batteries, the luminosity quoted in the product description isn't consistently provided by these lights- except on full, fresh batteries, the light is much dimmer than it can be when the light has fully powered batteries in it, so you'll end up going through batteries faster than normal (thankfully, the \"Amazon Basics\" AA batteries are very good quality & are very cheap compared to name-brands, so this is a solveable issue, just wasteful, seeing as you end up tossing batteries which still hold some charge- I've ended up using the 1\/2 dead flashlight batteries in my cable box remotes in an effort not to waste them).2- Like many of the economical flashlights being sold of this design type, sometimes the power-button press to cycle between modes happens without your input, turning on the strobe setting or the lower light output setting without my intending to do so by pressing the power button.PROS:1- These lights are very compact, yet with fully charged batteries, they have a high light output for their size. Given the amount of light they provide when fully powered, they do a good job to the point that my wife always keeps one in her purse & her car for being about at night &\/or walking our dog after dark.2- Unlike many of the other flashlights I've bought of this design\/type, these lights have held up quality-wise over a decent amount of use- working just as they well as they did when they'd 1st arrived.3- The price asked would be inexpensive for 1 CREE-type LED light of this design & high quality, so very good value for a 2 pack!Overall I certainly recommend them if you're looking for a good, low-cost & compact CREE-type LED, zoomable flashlight which works well & is of good quality..","image":false},{"author":"Coconut eater","review_title":"It's a great personal LED flashlight that easily fits into a pocket.","rate":"5.0 out of 5 stars","date":"on February 10, 2018","review_format":"Color: Black","declarative":"Verified Purchase","review_body":"Tiny yet powerful and the battery charge seems to last a long time.","image":false},{"author":"Dr. LRF, DPT","review_title":"One battery and it lights up like a police helicopter","rate":"5.0 out of 5 stars","date":"on February 10, 2018","review_format":"Color: Black","declarative":"Verified Purchase","review_body":"My husband is obsessed with this flashlight.

The issue is with the switch logic.  There is a single switch that turns it on\/off (hard press) and changes the mode (half press).

If you turn it off and on you will have bright light, dimmer light, and the strobe mode and it's somewhat annoying when you're trying to just use a damn flashlight and have to turn it off and on just to get the right light or at least not turn on in strobe mode.

My commute to work is about 20min., which I do by bike after dark 3-4x\/wk. I always used the strobe because it is more conspicuous and drains the battery less than a steady beam, and is legal for a bike headlight in Florida. At first I was very happy with the brightness, but after 2-3wks. the light would require many clicks of the switch to turn on. Then it would go dark during my trip, and afterwards it wouldn't come on at all. This started after a total use of less than 3hrs. in strobe function, and the battery still had plenty of charge. I tried the 2nd light, and had a similar experience. Not wanting to continue risking my life, I tried to return the item, but it was not eligable.

With a fresh battery, these lights struggled to light the bushes from 50 yards away. That does not mean if you want to use these babies in the attic, while checking the rat traps, you wont have great light, but when you zoom the lens for a tighter Beam... you'll find a \"square\" which is emitted by the LED module\/crystal. Which is okay, (for kids) but not great if you need to really see that \"thing\" that is right there... LOOKIN BACK AT YOU ......  All in all, this is great deal for a four pack of flashlights that you can give to the kids for a camping trip, to keep them all on the same wave, but if you're looking for something else to keep you out of the dark, and give yourself a chance to stay ahead of the critters... try something else.","image":false},{"author":"tugce","review_title":"They work great.

After less than four months, it's broken.  Something is rattling around inside, it won't zoom in all the way any more, and there are two rubber band like things that (I'm guessing) used to be inside the flashlight and are very likely related to why it isn't working any more.  My work backpack has a pocket on the shoulder strap. It had been in that pocket for maybe a month before I discovered it had broken.This flashlight is not rugged. Not even a little.  If clipping it on an office worker's backpack for a month breaks something... Well let's just say I'm glad I didn't get into a situation where I was relying on this light. Very glad.Oh, and nothing at all on this product offering about warranty, how to return it, etc.  Honestly, I wouldn't accept a replacement. Only a refund.One other and less important gripe: The pocket clip is way too rigid and is really hard to get on anything.  That's why I put it on the pocket on my backpack shoulder strap. I couldn't even get the clip over the edge of my jeans pocket without using a tool to pry it open.Move on...get something else. Anything.

The second light had an issue with the focusing collar. Extending the collar took a greater amount of effort over the first one and it snapped back upon releasing it. If there's an o-ring inside, it's too snug and is creating vacuum on extension. It doesn't snap back all the way leaving about one-eighth inch gap. The only way I could retract it all the way was by rotating the collar as I pressed down and as I pulled up. Eventually I could fully extend it and retract it with no issues. The same flashlight had a short issue with the switch. One day upon pressing the on-off button it flashed on momentarily then remained off. Pushing down on the button had no effect and the switch would not lock in position. It wouldn't even rotate to the next position. I Removed the switch portion from the main body and tapped it on a table and tried pressing again. No change. I eventually screwed the switch back figuring that it was broken. After screwing it back on I tried  pushing the button one last time. It worked again! Probably some debris inside the switch worked free. I was going to ask the seller for a new switch as the problem could occur again at some inconvenient future time.","image":false},{"author":"RaddMan","review_title":"Five Stars","rate":"5.0 out of 5 stars","date":"on September 1, 2017","review_format":"Color: Black","declarative":"Verified Purchase","review_body":"two small flashlights that light things you point at.","image":false},{"author":"UK Wildcats","review_title":"Love them","rate":"4.0 out of 5 stars","date":"on September 1, 2017","review_format":"Color: Black","declarative":"Verified Purchase","review_body":"They work great.","image":false},{"author":"Amazon Customer","review_title":"Four Stars","rate":"4.0 out of 5 stars","date":"on September 1, 2017","review_format":"Color: 6 pack","declarative":"Verified Purchase","review_body":"Handy little things to have around the house and in the car.

There are 3 different modes: high beam, low beam and flashing and it only takes one AA battery. My son loves the handy built-in clip; he can clip the flashlight to his pant pocket, on his shirt or where ever it fancies him. Only flaw to me is that the clip is quite stiff so it can be difficult trying to clip it on but it definitely stays in place. Overall, these are great, sturdy little lights for the money.

The only two downsides are that the clip is tempered and will break if you try to bend it a little more so it's easier to clip on your pocket. The other is that when you turn it off, and then back on it goes to the next mode. So if you turn it off on the bright setting and turn it turn it back on, it'll be on the low setting. The modes are bright, low, & strobe. So I just switch it to strobe before I turn it off, that way it comes on bright. Not a deal breaker for me.

Next is a more.focused beam just pull on the flashlight and you get a smaller more focused beam of light in a square. Next is a flashing mode. I like this one best because I will take the dogs for a walk in the morning before it is light out and I can use this in flashing mode attach it to my jacket so that drivers can see me.Overall I have been very impressed with the quality of this flashlight.

I personally carry one in my purse for those times when I am going to my car late in the evening and need a light to see.  I take evening classes and sometimes going to my car is a little scary, so I really like having the flashlight readily available. It eases my stress and fears waking to my car being able to actually see.  We recently lost power and I used my rockbird flashlight most of the evening. I was amazed at how long and well it worked. I am very happy with these flashlights and look forward to using them for camping and hiking over the summer.

The focus on them is fun, but usually not very necessary. They seem like they can handle a pretty good beating. I carry one on my belt at work as it is compact, lightweight, and it comes in really handy. The only complaint I have is I wish the belt clip was heavier; I snagged it on my bench the other day while I was working and bent it all up. I took off the clip (held on by two small allen screws) and applied some love with a pair of pliers and it works great again. I don't know if anyone else would have this problem and it's easy to fix, so it's not worth taking off a star.

I gave my husband one to use in his tow truck and one stays in the house for me. These flashlights are very bright and you can adjust the scope of the light from a large area to a precise close area. I use my flashlight in the house to check on eggs in an incubator so I pull the top of the flashlight out to narrow the scope. It is plenty bright for me to see the babies in the eggs. My husband has used his for lots of things in the tow truck. It is great for lots of jobs since it has adjustable lighting. It's also easy for him to keep on himself with the metal clip and non-slip grip.  I like that they are made with aluminium so they are lightweight and durable.

It works great, it\u2019s small and economical.This flashlight can run on either one of these batteries:* 1 size AA (regular 1.5v battery), easy to find and cheap.or* 1 size 14500 (3.7v battery), harder to find and more expensive, but brighter.Depending on the battery you use, the light is dimmer or brighter:a) On a single AA battery, I would estimate 130 lumens.  To me this is very bright on a single regular battery. I compared to another light I have that is advertized as 130 lumens by Energizer, it is very close to the same brightness in my opinion.  To me 130 lumens is great task lighting.b) On a single 14500 battery, the company claims 300 lumens and I believe it.  300 lumens is INTENSE, probably TOO much for task lighting.  You likely would like this more for walking in the dark, where the light is out away from you more.Other points:a) Uses a 3 click switch.  Press once for full brightness.  Press quickly twice for1\/2 brightness.  3 times for fast blinking at full bright.b) The front of the flashlight pulls in\/out to focus the beam.  It works well and stays where you put it.c) The light color is a slight shift towards blue from absolute white.  But nothing extreme.d) Has a tail cap pushbutton switch is encased in rubber. This is great for one-handed operation.e) Doesn't easily do \"momentary on\". Momentary on is when it comes on by slightly pressing the switch and goes off when you release it. This light comes on when you release the button, not when you push it down. Fellow flashlight geeks call that a \"reverse clicky\".f) Says it\u2019s water resistant, but I doubt it is water proof.  However, I didn\u2019t dunk test it for water proof for fear of ruining it.","image":false},{"author":"Amazon Customer","review_title":"Great stocking stuffers","rate":"5.0 out of 5 stars","date":"on November 21, 2016","review_format":"Color: Black","declarative":"Verified Purchase","review_body":"These lights are Bright !!!!!

I can honestly say this is the best flashlight for the money. Yes there are brighter, better, and costlier flashlights than this, but it's value\/durability\/ability is off the charts.True story: 10 mins before I started writing this review, my girlfriend and I hear this terrible noise coming from our dryer. Yeah, that was my flashlight... It went through a complete full load, heavy setting, hot\/cold wash cycle and then hit the dryer for a quick jaunt.It's a good light.","image":false},{"author":"DM467","review_title":"Very decent.","rate":"4.0 out of 5 stars","date":"on November 16, 2016","review_format":"Color: Black","declarative":"Verified Purchase","review_body":"Only out of the box, no prolonged use. Its bright enought for an inmediate area search light but won't light up a room. For the price you pay for two, rates 4 stars. If it holds up longer than 2 months it'll be a five star item.","image":false},{"author":"Amazon Customer","review_title":"Five Stars","rate":"5.0 out of 5 stars","date":"on November 13, 2016","review_format":"Color: 4 Pack","declarative":"Verified Purchase","review_body":"thank you","image":false},{"author":"Amazon Customer","review_title":"Great","rate":"5.0 out of 5 stars","date":"on November 5, 2016","review_format":"Color: Black","declarative":"Verified Purchase","review_body":"Just received mine they're pretty bright with AA battery really impressed with this product and price","image":false},{"author":"TechNuT","review_title":"I love these flashlights","rate":"5.0 out of 5 stars","date":"on September 28, 2016","review_format":"Color: 4 Pack","declarative":"Verified Purchase","review_body":"I love these flashlights!
